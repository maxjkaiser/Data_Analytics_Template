# Data Folder

This folder contains the data files used for this project. The data is separated into two subfolders:

- **raw/**: Contains the raw data files as received.
- **cleaned/**: Contains the processed, cleaned data that is ready for analysis.

## Raw Data

The raw data files are stored here. These files should not be modified. If you need to process or clean the data, create a new notebook or script in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Cleaned Data

This folder will contain data that has been cleaned and preprocessed. It is ready to be used for analysis or modeling.
